The environment commands are defined in a set of four .vsct files:
- SharedCmdDef.vsct
- SharedCmdPlace.vsct
- ShellCmdDef.vsct
- ShellCmdPlace.vsct
These files are located in <Visual Studio SDK installation path>\VisualStudioIntegration\Common\Inc\. 
These files provide the definitions and GUIDs of the menus and groups that you can use in the command 
table configuration (.vsct) file of your VSPackage as containers for your own menus, groups, and commands.

Visual studio 2010 SDK SP1 folder for above:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SDK SP1\VisualStudioIntegration\Common\Inc\

Also, vsshlids.h in the same folder contains numeric IDs, useful for VSIPLogging feature at the top of 
these notes.

To debug, set Debug options to External Program and set path to devenv.exe.  Add "/rootsuffix Exp" to 
arguments to run with "Experimental" hive.  You can reset your experimental hive with the VS SDK 
start menu item "Reset the Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SP1 Experimental Instance".  This will copy
the standard VS hive to the Experimental hive.  You can update the version of the extension installed
by either uninstalling and reinstalling the .vsix or copying the build output to the install folder, 
for example: 

C:\Users\jnagy\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0Exp\Extensions\Jonathan Nagy\Compare Files\0.3\

Check the Output window during VS debug session and find extension load with file path with window 
search.  

Note:  If everything is lined up, the experimental installation will update automatically when compiling 
the project.
